# poisonOS

poisonOS is a hobby OS that im bulding from scratch, using C and assembly x86. inspired by TempleOS, but desgined with more structured, windows-like approach. no security you can control everything, change color change lay-out, just full acces and full control. //town

## Features 

- Costum bootloader
- 1280x720 resolution support(1280x720 is the king)
- Text rendering with 16-color theme (mostly green and black, and some white) //emiaptyuri
- Simple kernel with output functions and memory allocator
- Modular design: screen, memory, IO, and more as separate components

### why?

- Learn real system-level programing
- Write a full OS from scratch
- Understand and control hardware direclly
- BUild something personal and meaningful

#### warning

this OS is **NOT** meant to be secure, efficient, the next linux or safe. it's low-level sandbox for learning and just messing around.
